# Gambling-game
This gambling game was created by my friend and me in our free time last year about the same time as now. In the files there are 2 versions of the game, which the Base version is earlier but almost full version. The Home edition is newer version with saving system, that keeps your stats in newly created folder in documents. It also adds a cheatcode which can be used to add money.

# Credit
I'm crediting my friend Mathew for making the graphical interface and input filter.
